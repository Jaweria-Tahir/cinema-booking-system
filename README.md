- Choose seat types (Standard, Premium, Luxury) and make payments
- Cancel bookings and restore seat availability
- View and rate movies with an average rating system
- Order food items and manage a queue of pending orders
- Find the nearest theater using Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm

 Key Features:

2. Payment via simulated options: EasyPaisa, Card, Wallet, Cash
3. Rating system using Binary Search Tree (BST)
4. Food Ordering using Queue
5. Booking History using List
6. Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm for nearest theater search
